NAME
    DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::ISBN - Auto-create Business::ISBN objects
    from columns.

VERSION
    Version 0.04000

SYNOPSIS
    Load this component and declare columns as ISBNs with the appropriate
    format.

        package Library;
        __PACKAGE__->load_components(qw/InflateColumn::ISBN Core/);
        __PACKAGE__->add_columns(
            isbn => {
                data_type => 'varchar',
                size => 13,
                is_nullable => 0,
                is_isbn => 1,
                as_string => 0,
            }
        );

    It has to be a varchar rather than a simple integer given that it is
    possible for ISBNs to contain the character X. Old style ISBNs are 10
    characters, not including hyphens, but new style ones are 13 characters.

    The "as_string" attribute is optional, and if set to 1 then values will
    be stored in the database with hyphens in the appopriate places. In this
    case, an extra 3 characters will be required.

    Then you can treat the specified column as a Business::ISBN object.

        print 'ISBN: ', $book->isbn->as_string;
        print 'Publisher code: ', $book->isbn->publisher_code;

METHODS
  isbn_class
    Arguments: $class

    Gets/sets the address class that the columns should be inflated into.
    The default class is Business::ISBN and only that is currently
    supported.

  register_column
    Chains with "register_column" in DBIx::Class::Row, and sets up ISBN
    columns appropriately. This would not normally be called directly by end
    users.
